// Package stringex helps when working with strings. So SplitFilter()
// and SplitMap() split given strings by a separator and user defined
// functions are called for each part to filter or map those.
//
// Matches() provides a more simple string matching than regular
// expressions. Patterns are ? for one char, * for multiple chars,
// and [aeiou] or [0-9] for group or ranges of chars. Both can
// be negotiated with [^abc] while the pattern chars also can
// be escaped with \.
//
// While the Valuer defines the interface to anything that may
// return a value as string the Default helps to interpret these
// strings as other data types. In case they don't match a default
// value will be returned.
//
// Processor defines an interface for the processing of strings.
// Those easily can be chained or used for stream splitting again
// working with processor chains. Some processors are already
// pre-defined.
