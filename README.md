## Description

**Tideland Go Text** simplifies life with text data.

* `etc` manages configurations including internel references to environment variables, cross references, and extraction of subtrees for using types; syntax is `sml` (see below)
* `gjp` is the generic JSON processing without static type marshalling
* `scroller` helps analyzing a continuously written line by line text content like log files
* `sml` is the simple markup language, a LISP like notation using curly braces
* `stringex` enhances the functionality of the standard library package `strings`

I hope you like it. ;)
